# Data Science Projects (Python)
This will be my portfolio for learning python.

## Project 1: Titanic
The Kaggle Titanic Challenge provides the dataset for analysis on what sorts of people were likely to survive. 

## Project 2: Stock Market Prediction
I used the data from the stock market and pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it. I also completed a risk analysis and predicting future stock price through Monte Carlo.

## Project 3: Election
I looked at the election data from the 2012 election and tried to answer the following questions:

1. Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
2. Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?
3. How do undecided voters effect the poll?
4. Can we account for the undecided voters?
5. How did voter sentiment change over time?
6. Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

## Project 4: Web Scraping
This project uses Python to scrape information from the web.
