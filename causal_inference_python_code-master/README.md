# _Causal Inference_ Python Code

This repo contains Python code for the book _Causal Inference_ Part II, by Miguel Hern√°n and James Robins ([book site](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)).

The code here roughly corresponds to the Stata, R, or SAS programs found at the book site.


## Python dependencies

Required Python packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- statsmodels
- scipy
- matplotlib
- linearmodels
- tqdm

If you use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, you'll have most of those packages already, and you'll only need to install

- linearmodels
- tqdm


## Data

The data can be obtained from the [book site](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/).

The notebooks all assume that the Excel version of the data has been saved in the same directory as the notebooks.
